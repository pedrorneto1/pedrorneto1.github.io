# Resume Web page

> This page is a work in progress

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

> This project is a confluence of multiple goals and challenges I set myself to do.
 - I am using Google Firebase Studio and AI-driven software development to improve my technical knowledge and skills in these activities;
 - I am building a Resume website for myself.

> I believe that AI-driven SD can help rookies to pursue professional development, as it works as an accelerator for their workflow, also stimulating the developer to use its critical thinking abilities to evaluate the content generated and provided by the AI models, allowing them to search by themselves and helping them to access information faster. For me, this approach seems to save time in the process for those that are not skilled in some subject, giving them a powerful tool of learning, that enables them to create applications they previously could not do.

> AI is a tool, not the ultimate answer. The results will depend of how you use it. 😉👍
