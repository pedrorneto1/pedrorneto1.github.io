## Setting up GitHub Connection

Ok, I can help you with that. First, we need to initialize a git repository in the project's directory, then commit the existing code, and finally, connect it to a remote repository on GitHub.

Here are the steps I will follow:


Initialize a Git repository: Run git init in the terminal.
Stage all files: Run git add . to add all project files to the staging area.
Commit the files: Run git commit -m "Initial commit" to commit the staged files.
Connect to a remote GitHub repository:
You need to create an empty repository on GitHub.
Copy the remote repository URL from GitHub.
Run git remote add origin <repository-url> to add the remote.
Push the code to GitHub: Run git push -u origin main to push the code.
Please note that the main branch might be master depending on how the repository is initialized.
